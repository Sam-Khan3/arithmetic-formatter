# Arithmetic Formatter Project
This project is part of the freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python certification. It involved creating a Python function (`arithmetic_arranger`) that arranges given arithmetic problems vertically for easy readability. The function takes a list of arithmetic problems and returns a formatted string, with an option to include answers. It's designed to handle errors such as invalid inputs and too many problems. The project emphasizes string manipulation and formatting skills in Python.
